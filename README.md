# 📊Algo-comparision
Description: This project will showcase the real execution time vs the theoritical time complexity of different algorithm. 

Aim: To find the acuracy of the time complexity formula and understand the trend.

# 🔤Programming languages:-
➡️python:

a. matplotlib

b. time

c. numpy

d. random

#🧑‍💻Working

There are in total 9 files, out of which the main.py is the head file which helps in calling all the rest file as per the choice of user.

The rest 8 files contains 8 algorithms that work on different set of dataset to get an approximate graph on the real execution time, which in later phase is compared to the graph of theoritical time complexity found by the formula.
